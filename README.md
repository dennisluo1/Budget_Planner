## What is Budget Planner?

Budget Planner is an web application that allows users to record their daily expenses. The idea behind this concept is that if users have to record their expenses, they will become more aware of their spending habits. Budger Planner also provides resources and insights into millennial investing. 


## Inspiration Behind Budget Planner 

When I was in my teenage years, I attended a business high school that taught classes relating to accounting, investing, financial markets, and personal finance. After finishing high school, I went on to pursue my bachelors in business. While a student at Skidmore College, I realized that many of my peers had never taken a course relating to personal finance and did not consider themselves financially saavy. With this app, I wanted to create a report that allows users to track their expenses. Budget Planner will also provide useful information and resources on personal finance for millennials.

For Budget Planner, I decided to focus on React and Rails to build this platform. Originally, I wanted to build my entire platform using Ruby on Rails but React is a much quicker JS library for the front-end. On the back-end, I decided to use Rails. In addition I decided to use CoffeeScript in order to display code that would be simpler to understand. Additionally, Bootstrap is a great front-end component that I decided to incorporate to display a more beautiful layout of the app. 

## Technical Discussion

* React: Used for interactive front-end
* Ruby on Rails: Used for back-end
* CoffeeScript: JS syntax used to display code that is easier to understand 
* Bootstrap: Used to add beautiful styling to design of app

## Challenges

Some of my biggest challenges encountered along the way using CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript is very precise when it comes to syntax and a slight space can affect the overall functionality of the code. In addition another roadblock was perfecting the set up of the CRUD system. In particular the edit/update functionality took quite some time to fix as there were several bugs and other setbacks along the way.

## Opportunities for Future Growth
The next step of budget planner is to incorporate a budget calculator that will allow users to input their income and receive an estimate of how much they should be saving per month and year on expenses such as: rent, transportation, utilities, food, medical, and personal.    

In addition, it will be incredibly important to set up an login/authentication to store users expenses into their personal account. Users will be able to not only store their expense history but also information regarding a budget calculation of their income history. Ideally, anyone and everyone is allow to use this tool without setting up an account to maintain their privacy.
