# Budget_Planner


## What is Budget Planner?

Budget Planner is an web application that allows users to record their daily expenses. The idea behind this concept is that if users have to record their expenses, they will become more aware of their spending habits. Budger Planner also provides resources and insights into millennial investing. 


## Inspiration Behind Budget Planner 

When I was in my teenage years, I attended a business high school that taught classes relating to accounting, investing, financial markets, and personal finance. After finishing high school, I went on to pursue my bachelors in business. While a student at Skidmore College, I realized that many of my peers had never taken a course relating to personal finance and did not consider themselves financially saavy. With this app, I wanted to create a report that allows users to track their expenses. Budget Planner will also provide useful information and resources on personal finance for millennials.

## Opportunities for Future Growth
The next step of budget planner is to incorporate a budget calculator that will allow users to input their income and receive an estimate of how much they should be saving per month and year on expenses such as: rent, transportation, utilities, food, medical, and personal.    

In addition, it will be incredibly important to set up an login/authentication to store users expenses into their personal account. Users will be able to not only store their expense history but also information regarding a budget calculation of their income history.
