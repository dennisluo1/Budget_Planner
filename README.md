## What is Budget Planner?

Budget Planner is a financial calculator that calculates your monthly budget base on your yearly income. Budget Planner gives users an estimated monthly budget on how much an individual should be spending on housing, transportation, utilities, food, medical, miscellaneous, and personal expenses.

## Inspiration Behind Budget Planner 

When I was in my teenage years, I attended a business high school that taught classes such as accounting, investing, personal finance, and saving. After finishing high school, I went on to pursue my bachelors in business. While a student in college, I realized that many of my peers had never taken a course relating to personal finance and did not consider themselves financially saavy. With this app, I wanted to create a report that allows users to track their expenses. Budger Planner will also provide useful information and resources on personal finance for millennials.
